Purpose: Distribute Zoho support tickets based on number of tickets and types of
    tickets assigned.

Files:
    main.js - contains the functionality of distributing the tickets
    accessToken.js - contains code to gain access to Zoho Desk API
    config.js - contains configuration information

Documentation:
    * Setting the agent order (what order they receive tickets)
        ~ In Order (by ID) (column C), write the order of the agent IDs (which
            can be found in column B). The top ID will receive tickets first,
            and the bottom ID will receive tickets last.
        ~ In Priority On/Off (Column D), write "t" if the agent should have priority
            and "f" if the agent should have their tickets equally distributed with others.
        ~ All IDs must be used exactly once
    * Setting the maximum tickets per agent
        ~ Use column D to set the total maximum tickets for the given agent
        ~ Use column E to set the Waiting on Us tickets for the given agent
    * Adding an agent:
        ~ Set Total Tickets Max (column E) and Waiting on Us Tickets Max (column F)
            to all values of 0
        ~ Run the program - it will automatically add in the new agent to the sheet
        ~ Then set the numbers to the actual desired values and rerun
    * You should only be changing columns C, D, E, F and cell K1
        ~ Column G gets updated when the program is run - it shows how many tickets
            each agent has after they have been delegated
    * Choosing the department:
        ~ Type in the name of the department (as written in the Departments sheet)
            into cell K1 (next to where it says department)
        ~ I would make this a dropdown but apparently that also gets erased
            (similar to styling)
    * Adding a department
        ~ Go to the main page on Zoho
        ~ Click the gear icon in the top right (Setup)
        ~ Click "Departments" in the "General" category
        ~ Click on the desired department
        ~ Copy the numbers at the end of the link
        ~ Make a new entry in the Departments sheet in the Excel sheet - write the
            department name and paste the ID
    * Errors
        ~ If there are errors, it should display them in the console. If you
            get an error, ask Auriel - don't try and fix it unless you know
            what you are doing
    * Access tokens
        ~ In general, the program should deal with access tokens on its own
        ~ If the refresh token expires, a manual process is required:
            1. Go to https://api-console.zoho.com/
            2. Click on 'Self Client'
            3. Under 'Scope', write 'Desk.tickets.ALL,Desk.tickets.UPDATE,Desk.basic.READ,Desk.settings.READ,Desk.search.READ'
            4. Click 'Create'
            5. Once you get the code, copy and paste it into 'code' in the 'config.js' file
            6. Go to line 10 of 'main.js' and uncomment it - the line says 'tokenFuncs.createOriginalTokens();'
            7. Run 'node main.js'

Other Notes:
    * Do not change the formatting of the Excel sheet. Changing the style also won't
        save so it won't hurt but it will waste your time.
    * All of these files should be in the same folder
    * This code is not efficient, especially in dealing with searching through
        and updating values regarding the agents. If Modix grows to a huge size,
        the program may slow down (though most likely it won't make much of a
        difference).
