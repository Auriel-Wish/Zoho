Purpose: Distribute Zoho support tickets based on number of tickets and types of
    tickets assigned.

Files:
    main.js - contains the functionality of distributing the tickets
    accessToken.js - contains code to gain access to Zoho Desk API
    config.js - contains configuration information

Documentation:
    * Do not change the formatting of the Excel sheet. Changing the style also won't
        save so it won't hurt but it will waste your time.
    * Adding an agent:
        ~ Set Total Tickets Max (column D) and Waiting on Us Tickets Max (column E)
            to all values of 0
        ~ Run the program - it will automatically add in the new agent to the sheet
        ~ Then set the numbers to the actual desired values and rerun
    * Choosing the department:
        ~ Type in the name of the department (as written in the Departments sheet)
            into cell J1 (next to where it says department)
        ~ I would make this a dropdown but apparently that also gets erased
            (similar to styling)
    * Setting the agent order (what order they receive tickets)
        ~ In Order (by ID) (column C), write the order of the agent IDs (which
            can be found in column B). The top ID will receive tickets first,
            and the bottom ID will receive tickets last.
        ~ All IDs must be used exactly once
    * Setting the maximum tickets per agent
        ~ Use column D to set the total maximum tickets for the given agent
        ~ Use column E to set the Waiting on Us tickets for the given agent
    * You should only be changing columns C, D, E, and cell J1
        ~ Column F gets updated when the program is run - it shows how many tickets
            each agent has after they have been delegated
    * This code is not efficient, especially in dealing with searching through
        and updating values regarding the agents. If Modix grows to a huge size,
        the program may slow down (though most likely it won't make much of a
        difference).
